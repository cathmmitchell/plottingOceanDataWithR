# Plotting Ocean Data With R

Tutorial for R workshop at Bigelow: April 1st and 2nd 2021
 
For this tutorial we're going to use some water column data from the Damariscotta River. 
The data spans 3 years and is at four locations along the river. 

To view the tutorial, click on the `plottingOceanDataWithR.md` file above (*not* the `.Rmd` file).

The R script you can use to follow along with the tutorial is `plottingOceanData-script.R`. 

The data is in the `DamariscottaRiverData.csv` file, in the data folder. 

**Before the workshop: download both the R script and the data file using the instructions below**

## Downloading files from GitHub

Download this file and save it in your working directory. You can download the file by:

1. Click on the file name (i.e. either `DamariscottaRiverData.csv` or `plottingOceanData-script.R`)
2. Right click on `View raw` (center of screen) or the `Raw` button (to the right)
3. Select `Save link as`
4. Save the file into your working directory.


## Additional Information

The following information is not required for doing the workshop, but here for those interested.

### Wiki

There is a Wiki that accompanies this GitHub repository (click the Wiki link on the second from top toolbar). 
The Wiki contains a couple of pages with more details, plus additional plotting and analysis examples. 

### Challenge Solutions

The tutorial contains some challenges, you can find the solutions to these in `challengeSolutions.md`.

### R notebooks

The `.Rmd` files are the R notebooks that were used to write the tutorial and challenge solutions. The tutorial
and challenge solution markdown files (`.md`) and the associated folders (which contain all the images for each
file) were created by knitting the R notebooks into a `github_output` document. Feel free to use these notebooks
as templates for creating your own. 

## 

This tutorial is based on labs for the Sea Change Semester and DamariscottaRiverData is a subset of all 
the collated cruise data (CTD data from a few years only).
